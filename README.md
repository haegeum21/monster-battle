# Monster Battle Game

*"Monster Battle"* is a dynamic web-based role-playing game developed using Vue.js, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This engaging project features a user interface where players can participate in a thrilling battle against a virtual monster. The game showcases two progress bars representing the health points (HP) of the player and the monster.

Players can choose from a range of actions, including attacking, healing, unleashing special attacks, or surrendering. Each action triggers randomized attack effects, creating an element of surprise and strategy in the game. The battle's progression and outcomes are documented in a real-time battle log that displays points earned after each action.
